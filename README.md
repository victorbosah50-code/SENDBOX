# Sendbox - Modern File Collaboration Prototype

Licensed under the Apache License 2.0

Sendbox is a **Dropbox-style file collaboration tool prototype** with:

- Voice commands for file upload, send, and create
- Interactive dashboard
- Pricing plans (monthly/yearly)
- Free demo with IP-based restriction (3 sends max)
- Simulated Stripe-style payment for paid plans
- LocalStorage-based login/signup simulation
- Modern UI/UX

## How to Run

1. Copy all files into a GitHub repository called `sendbox`.
2. Enable **GitHub Pages** in repository settings (main branch / root).
3. Open the GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/sendbox/`).
4. Test login/signup, voice commands, file dashboard, pricing, and free demo.

> Note: This is a **front-end live prototype only**. No real backend or file storage exists. Payments are simulated.
